# data_analysis_capstone_project
I would like to share with you the skills I acquired during the Bootcamp process and the analyses I conducted in this project. Throughout the Bootcamp process, I learned to effectively use database management systems such as PostgreSQL and gained significant experience in data analysis and querying.

In our project, I conducted a series of analyses using the Northwind company's database. These analyses included key performance indicators such as net profit, discounts, gross profit, number of products, average shipping time, as well as more detailed analyses such as identifying customers who paid the highest shipping fees, the order quantities of the top 5 customers, and the geographic distribution of customers.

During this process, I enhanced my skills in effectively analyzing data, creating complex queries in database systems like PostgreSQL, and presenting results with meaningful visualizations. This project provided me with an opportunity to develop both technical skills and analytical thinking abilities.
